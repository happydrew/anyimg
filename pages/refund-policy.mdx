# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: April 13, 2025**

At AnyImg, owned by ZHU GE ("we," "our," or "us"), we strive to ensure your complete satisfaction with our AI image creation service. This Refund Policy outlines when and how you can request refunds for purchased credits.

## Refund Eligibility

### Unused Credits Refund

We offer proportional refunds for unused credits according to the following guidelines:

1. **Refund Calculation**: Refunds are calculated based on the percentage of unused credits remaining in your account at the time of the refund request.

   For example:
   - If you purchased 100 credits for $5 and have used 30 credits, you are eligible for a refund of $3.50 (70% of the original purchase price).
   - If you purchased 200 credits for $10 and have used 100 credits, you are eligible for a refund of $5 (50% of the original purchase price).

2. **Minimum Refund Threshold**: Refund requests must be for accounts with at least 10% of the original purchased credits remaining.

3. **Time Limitation**: Refund requests must be submitted within 90 days of the original purchase date.

### Technical Issues

If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using our service or properly generating images despite having available credits, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund at our discretion.

### Accidental Purchases

If you made an accidental duplicate purchase or unintended purchase, please contact us immediately (within 24 hours) for a full refund consideration.
