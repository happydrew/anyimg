# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: April 5, 2025**

At AnyImg, we strive to ensure your complete satisfaction with our AI image creation service. This Refund Policy outlines when and how you can request refunds for purchased credits.

## Refund Eligibility

### Unused Credits Refund

We offer proportional refunds for unused credits according to the following guidelines:

1. **Refund Calculation**: Refunds are calculated based on the percentage of unused credits remaining in your account at the time of the refund request.

   For example:
   - If you purchased 100 credits for $5 and have used 30 credits, you are eligible for a refund of $3.50 (70% of the original purchase price).
   - If you purchased 200 credits for $10 and have used 100 credits, you are eligible for a refund of $5 (50% of the original purchase price).

2. **Minimum Refund Threshold**: Refund requests must be for accounts with at least 10% of the original purchased credits remaining.

3. **Time Limitation**: Refund requests must be submitted within 90 days of the original purchase date.

### Technical Issues

If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using our service or properly generating images despite having available credits, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund at our discretion.

### Accidental Purchases

If you made an accidental duplicate purchase or unintended purchase, please contact us immediately (within 24 hours) for a full refund consideration.
